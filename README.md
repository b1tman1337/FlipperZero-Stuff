# Flipper Zero Software and Hardware

- [Flipper Zero ONLY Official Website](https://flipperzero.one)
- [Flipper Zero Github Repository](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/tree/dev).

# What does this repository contain?
- This [repository](https://github.com/b1tman1337/FlipperZero-Stuff/tree/main) contains my projects with my flipper zero. Most likely some NFC, BADUSB, SUB-GHZ files which you can load with your Flipper Zero and use them.
